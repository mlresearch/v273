title: Efficient Multi-Task Inference with a Shared Backbone and Lightweight Task-Specific
  Adapters for Automatic Scoring
abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education requires scalable
  and efficient frameworks that balance performance, adaptability, and cost. This
  paper addresses these needs by proposing a shared backbone model architecture enhanced
  with lightweight LoRA adapters for task-specific fine-tuning, targeting the automated
  scoring of student responses across 27 mutually exclusive tasks. By achieving competitive
  performance (average QWK of 0.848 compared to 0.888 for fully fine-tuned models)
  while reducing GPU memory consumption by 60% and inference latency by 40%, the framework
  demonstrates significant efficiency gains. This approach aligns with the workshopâ€™s
  focus on improving language models for educational tasks, creating responsible innovations
  for cost-sensitive deployment, and supporting educators by streamlining assessment
  workflows. The findings underscore the potential of scalable AI to enhance learning
  outcomes while maintaining fairness and transparency in automated scoring systems.
