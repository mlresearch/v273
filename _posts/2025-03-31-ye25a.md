title: Can LLMs Teach Human Learners to Understand Concepts Through Analogies?
abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant potential to revolutionize
  education by enabling personalized and effective learning experiences. As cognitive
  learning principles are gradually applied to designing educative LLMs, our research
  focuses on this crucial question: can LLMs enhance student comprehension of complex
  concepts through analogy-based tutoring, a pedagogical method proven useful in learning
  science? To address this, we propose a two-stage experimental framework. First,
  LLM tutors generate analogies for teaching specific target concepts, leveraging
  prompting techniques to adapt to simulated or real student profiles. Second, these
  learners engage with the analogies and subsequently complete multiple-choice question
  to evaluate their conceptual understanding. Our initial findings reveal that analogy-based
  tutoring enhances student engagement and conceptual mastery, achieving a notable
  improvement in comprehension. These results underscore the effectiveness of LLM-driven
  analogy-based tutoring in advancing educational outcomes and pave the way for future
  research in this domain.'
