title: 'BIBLIOSMIA: Hyper-Personalized Consistent Stories for Enhanced Social Emotional
  Learning'
abstract: 'Consistent visual storytelling plays a central role in how humans teach
  their children to understand their emotions, relationships with others and the world
  around them. It enhances children’s cognitive and social-emotional development by
  providing engaging, believable narratives that help them navigate emotional complexities
  in a safe, imaginative context. This prevalence of visual storytelling in our lives
  has made it a prime application for technological advancements in artificial intelligence
  (AI). With AI integrations, digital stories can be created across an infinite set
  of topics and readily adapted to personalized contexts. As image generation algorithms
  advance, digital storytelling can be enhanced even further to incorporate visual
  elements that are unique to the author or the desired reader population. However,
  the burgeoning field of multi-modal story generation currently suffers from the
  problem of consistency - a critical element for preserving the plot lines of a story
  and the ability of children to relate to the characters therein. To mitigate this,
  we propose Bibliosmia, a novel framework for designing consistent digital stories.
  The framework encompasses three main components: a story generation module, an alignment
  module and an image generation and validation module that collectively preserve
  key narrative and visual story elements to allow expert and new authors alike to
  craft deeply personal developmental stories for children. We evaluated the effectiveness
  of the framework in the context of an online automatic story generation application.
  Our experimental results demonstrate Bibliosmia’s superior performance in prompt
  similarity (0.307 CLIP Score) and near-top-tier identity consistency (0.860 CLIP
  Score), surpassing other approaches in scalability and user satisfaction. These
  findings highlight Bibliosmia’s effectiveness in delivering high-quality, personalized
  storytelling experiences, setting a new standard in multi-modal digital storytelling.'
