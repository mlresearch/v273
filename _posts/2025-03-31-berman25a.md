title: 'Facts Do Care About Your Language: Assessing Answer Quality of Multilingual
  LLMs'
abstract: Factuality is a necessary precursor to useful educational tools. As adoption
  of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education continues of grow, ensuring correctness
  in all settings is paramount. Despite their strong English capabilities, LLM performance
  in other languages is largely untested. In this work, we evaluate the correctness
  of the Llama3.1 family of models in answering factual questions appropriate for
  middle and high school students. We demonstrate that LLMs not only provide extraneous
  and less truthful information, but also exacerbate existing biases against rare
  languages.
