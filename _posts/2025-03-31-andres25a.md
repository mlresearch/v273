title: 'The LEVI training Hub: Evidence-Based Evaluation for AI in Education'
abstract: The rapid growth of education technology (ed tech) tools, including AI-powered
  applications, has highlighted the need for robust evaluation frameworks, particularly
  at early development stages. Current evaluation models, such as the Every Student
  Succeeds Act (ESSA) evidence tiers created by the U.S. Department of Education,
  may be appropriate for many education research activities, but miss critical stages
  in emerging AI-driven interventions. To support the Learning Engineering Virtual
  Institute (LEVI), a research collaboratory with the goal of doubling math learning
  rates in middle school students, we have developed a new evidence matrix to bridge
  this gap. This matrix incorporates a two-dimensional approach that evaluates research
  methods alongside outcome variables, enabling nuanced assessments of interventions
  along an ordered process. By categorizing research methods into five levels â€” ranging
  from randomized controlled trials to qualitative studies and modeling efforts, this
  matrix ensures comprehensive evaluation. Complementary outcome measures, emphasizing
  math learning gains, engagement, and model performance, contextualize these findings.
  This framework fosters alignment between research rigor and practical application,
  offering valuable insights into scaling educational innovations responsibly.
