title: 'AI Mentors for Student Projects: Spotting Early Issues in Computer Science
  Proposals'
abstract: 'When executed well, project-based learning (PBL) engages students’ intrinsic
  motivation, encourages students to learn far beyond a course’s limited curriculum,
  and prepares students to think critically and maturely about the skills and tools
  at their disposal. However, educators experience mixed results when using PBL in
  their classrooms: some students thrive with minimal guidance and others flounder.
  Early evaluation of project proposals could help educators determine which students
  need more support, yet evaluating project proposals and student aptitude is time-consuming
  and difficult to scale. In this work, we design, implement, and conduct an initial
  user study (n= 36) for a software system that collects project proposals and aptitude
  information to support educators in determining whether a student is ready to engage
  with PBL. We find that (1) users perceived the system as helpful for writing project
  proposals and identifying tools and technologies to learn more about, (2) educator
  ratings indicate that users with less technical experience in the project topic
  tend to write lower-quality project proposals, and (3) GPT-4o’s ratings show agreement
  with educator ratings. While the prospect of using LLMs to rate the quality of students’
  project proposals is promising, its long-term effectiveness strongly hinges on future
  efforts at characterizing indicators that reliably predict students’ success and
  motivation to learn.'
