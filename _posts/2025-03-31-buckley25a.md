title: A Personalized AI Coach to Assist in Self-Directed Learning
abstract: Personalized learning is a powerful tool in online education, yet its application
  in inquiry-based modeling environments remains underexplored. Previous work has
  shown that learners that engage in a cycle of construction, parameterization, and
  simulation, which we refer to as the exploration cycle, create models with higher
  complexity and variety. In order to further study these findings we present an “exploration
  coach” that provides personalized feedback within the Virtual Experimental Research
  Assistant (VERA)—an interactive learning environment for conceptual modeling of
  complex systems that evaluates models through agent-based simulations. Our architecture,
  which classifies learners into groups using clustering techniques, allows us to
  determine what type of feedback would be useful to a learner at any point in their
  modeling journey. The coach then uses procedural scaffolding to guide learners through
  the exploration cycle. Lastly we illustrate how these categorizations and the exploration
  cycle map onto the cycle of self-directed learning.
