title: 'ARCHED: A Human-Centered Framework for Transparent, Responsible, and Collaborative
  AI Assisted Instructional Design'
abstract: 'Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in educational technology reveals
  unprecedented opportunities to improve instructional design (ID), yet current approaches
  often prioritize automation over pedagogical rigor and human agency. This paper
  introduces ARCHED (AI for Responsible, Collaborative, Human-centered Education Instructional
  Design), a framework that implements a structured multi-stage workflow between educators
  and AI. Unlike existing tools that generate complete instructional materials autonomously,
  ARCHED cascades the development into distinct stages, from learning objective formulation
  to assessment design, each guided by Bloomâ€™s taxonomy and enhanced by LLMs. This
  framework employs multiple specialized AI components that work in concert: one generating
  diverse pedagogical options, another evaluating their alignment with learning objectives
  while maintaining human educators as primary decision-makers. ARCHED addresses critical
  gaps in current AI-assisted instructional design regarding transparency, pedagogical
  foundation, and meaningful human agency through this approach. This research advances
  the responsible integration of AI in education by providing a concrete, theoretically
  grounded framework that prioritizes human expertise and educational accountability.'
