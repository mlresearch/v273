title: Comparing Few-Shot Prompting of GPT-4 LLMs with BERT Classifiers for Open-Response
  Assessment in Tutor Equity Training
abstract: Assessing learners in ill-defined domains, such as scenario-based human
  tutoring training, is an area of limited research. Equity training requires a nuanced
  understanding of context, but do contemporary large language models (LLMs) have
  a knowledge base that can navigate these nuances? Legacy transformer models like
  BERT, in contrast, have less real-world knowledge but can be more easily fine-tuned
  than commercial LLMs. Here, we study whether fine-tuning BERT on human annotations
  outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo) with few-shot prompting
  and instruction. We evaluate performance on four prediction tasks involving generating
  and explaining open-ended responses in advocacy-focused training lessons in a higher
  education student population learning to become middle school tutors. Leveraging
  a dataset of 243 human-annotated open responses from tutor training lessons, we
  find that BERT demonstrates superior performance using an offline fine-tuning approach,
  which is more resource-efficient than commercial GPT models. We conclude that contemporary
  GPT models may not adequately capture nuanced response patterns, especially in complex
  tasks requiring explanation. This work advances the understanding of AI-driven learner
  evaluation under the lens of fine-tuning versus few-shot prompting on the nuanced
  task of equity training, contributing to more effective training solutions and assisting
  practitioners in choosing adequate assessment methods.
