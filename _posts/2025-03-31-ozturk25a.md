title: Enhancing Learning Outcomes within a Large-Scale Online Learning System through
  AI-Powered Feedback
abstract: Building on prior research, which demonstrated the effectiveness of a learning
  analytics-based feedback system in improving learner engagement and learning outcomes,
  this study addresses scalability challenges by automating feedback authoring using
  generative AI. Focusing on critical issues in distance education, including limited
  academic support, social isolation, and reduced learner motivation, we design and
  evaluate an AI-powered feedback system within a large-scale online learning environment.
  This study utilizes input data comprising learners’ online learning environment
  interactions, learning material engagement patterns, academic performance metrics,
  behavioral indicators, and demographic characteristics. The system generates AI-powered
  personalized feedback interventions based on the ARCS-V Motivation Model, Self-Regulated
  Learning principles, and Nudge Theory as its primary outputs. To assess the system’s
  effectiveness, more than 30,000 learners at a large distance education university
  will be randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. Preliminary work demonstrated
  the system’s readiness for a pilot evaluation. The next steps include assessing
  the system’s impact on diverse learner subgroups and refining system design based
  on user feedback. The study aims to advance our understanding of how AI-powered,
  personalized feedback influences self-regulated learning, motivation, and learning
  outcomes in online environments.
