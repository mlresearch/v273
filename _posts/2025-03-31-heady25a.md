title: AI Awareness Survey of Educators
abstract: In the age of Large Language Models (LLMs) purportedly being used by everyone,
  including students, do users actually know what theyâ€™re wielding? We present a study
  that aims to gauge the recognition of AI assisted processes in everyday life and
  understand what questions and concerns people have about AI. We particularly focus
  on educators, as the role of AI in the classroom raises concerns around technical
  and information literacy and the very nature of education.
