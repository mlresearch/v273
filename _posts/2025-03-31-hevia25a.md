title: Towards an Efficient, Customizable, and Accessible AI Tutor
abstract: We propose a novel AI tutoring system that combines a Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation (RAG) pipeline with a lightweight language model to provide efficient,
  customizable, and accessible educational support. Designed to operate offline with
  minimal computational resources, the system addresses the challenges faced by resource-constrained
  communities. To develop its knowledge capabilities, we explore various retrieval
  strategies starting from a knowledge base of college textbooks. This work lays the
  foundation for developing adaptable and equitable AI tutoring solutions that bridge
  educational gaps and empower learners in under-resourced communities.
