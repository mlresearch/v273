title: 'M2LADS Demo: A System for Generating Multimodal Learning Analytics Dashboards'
abstract: 'We present a demonstration of a web-based system called M2LADS (“System
  for Generating Multimodal Learning Analytics Dashboards”), designed to integrate,
  synchronize, visualize, and analyze multimodal data recorded during computer-based
  learning sessions with biosensors. This system presents a range of biometric and
  behavioral data on web-based dashboards, providing detailed insights into various
  physiological and activity-based metrics. The multimodal data visualized include
  electroencephalogram (EEG) data for assessing attention and brain activity, heart
  rate metrics, eye-tracking data to measure visual attention, webcam video recordings,
  and activity logs of the monitored tasks. M2LADS aims to assist data scientists
  in two key ways: (1) by providing a comprehensive view of participants’ experiences,
  displaying all data categorized by the activities in which participants are engaged,
  and (2) by synchronizing all biosignals and videos, facilitating easier data relabeling
  if any activity information contains errors.'
