title: Evaluating Fairness in AI-Assisted Remote Proctoring
abstract: 'Remote proctors make decisions about whether test takers have violated
  testing rules and, as a result, whether to certify test takers’ scores. These decisions
  rely on both AI signals and human evaluation of test-taking behaviors. Given that
  fairness is a key component of test validity evidence, it is critical that proctors’
  decisions are unbiased with respect to proctor and test-taker background characteristics
  (e.g., gender, age, and nationality). In this study, we empirically evaluate whether
  proctor or test-taker background characteristics affect whether a test taker is
  flagged for rule violations. Results suggest that proctor and test-taker nationality
  may influence proctoring decisions, whereas gender and age do not. The direction
  of the influence generally reflects an “in-group, out-group” bias: proctors are
  less likely to identify rule violations among test takers with similar nationalities
  as proctors (in-group favoring) and more likely to identify rule violations among
  test takers of different nationalities (out-group disfavoring). Results also suggest
  that decisions based on AI signals may be less prone to in-group/out-group bias
  than decisions based on human evaluation only, although more research is needed
  to support this finding.'
