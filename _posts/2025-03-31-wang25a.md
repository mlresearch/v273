title: Classroom Observation Evaluation with Large Language Models
abstract: To improve efficiency of evaluating classroom Instructional Support (IS)
  and enhance the reliability of the IS score evaluation system, we proposed a novel
  annotation protocol based on classroom discourse types and a framework which employed
  large language models (LLM) as the core component to estimate IS score automatically.
  We constructed the SentTag dataset which was annotated by the proposed annotation
  protocol. The Fleissâ€™ Kappa among all annotators was 0.7120. Additionally Llama
  3.1 models were fine-tuned on this dataset, achieving an accuracy of 0.7864 in classifying
  discourse types. While these features were not able to predict IS scores accurately
  (RMSE = 2.6584 and PCC = 0.1197), they could potentially serve as useful qualitative
  feedback to teachers on their classroom discourse. Future research will explore
  the integration of multimodal features, local session characteristics, and the generalization
  of the framework to diverse classroom settings.
