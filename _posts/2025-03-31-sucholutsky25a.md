title: Representational Alignment Supports Effective Teaching
abstract: A good teacher should not only be knowledgeable, but should also be able
  to communicate in a way that the student understands – to share the student’s representation
  of the world. In this work, we introduce a new controlled experimental setting,
  GRADE, to study pedagogy and representational alignment. We use GRADE through a
  series of machine-machine and machine-human teaching experiments to characterize
  a utility curve defining a relationship between representational alignment, teacher
  expertise, and student learning outcomes. We find that improved representational
  alignment with a student improves student learning outcomes (i.e., task accuracy),
  but that this effect is moderated by the size and representational diversity of
  the class being taught. We use these insights to design a preliminary classroom
  matching procedure, GRADE-Match, that optimizes the assignment of students to teachers.
  When designing machine teachers, our results suggest that it is important to focus
  not only on accuracy, but also on representational alignment with human learners.
