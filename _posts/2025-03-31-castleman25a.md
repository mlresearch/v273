title: 'Rethinking Math Benchmarks: Implications for AI in Education'
abstract: 'Several datasets have been created to evaluate LLM performance on mathematical
  reasoning tasks. Performance on these benchmarks is used as a proxy for a modelâ€™s
  math ability and to rank their capability relative to other models. These rankings
  play a crucial role for AIEd practitioners in selecting models for applications
  like math tutoring. Recent research has argued that several of these benchmarks
  have become too saturated, prompting the creation of new datasets with more difficult
  tasks. How can we gauge the effectiveness of these benchmarks for measuring math
  skills and producing reliable rankings? Leveraging the psychometric framework of
  Item Response Theory, we examine three math benchmarks: GSM8K, MATH, and MathOdyssey.
  We find that GSM8K and MathOdyssey are not suited to properly evaluate the current
  range of frontier model abilities, and are instead suited to models with lower and
  higher math abilities respectively. Moreover, current rankings derived from these
  benchmarks are unstable and fail to reliably capture the latent math ability they
  aim to measure. To remedy these issues, we recommend the integration of IRT analysis
  into the process of selecting questions for future benchmarks.'
