title: 'Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish: On the Extended Reading Articles Generation with
  LLMs'
abstract: The process of creating educational materials is both time-consuming and
  demanding for educators. This research explores the potential of Large Language
  Models (LLMs) to streamline this task by automating the generation of extended reading
  materials and relevant course suggestions. Using the TED-Ed Dig Deeper sections
  as an initial exploration, we investigate how supplementary articles can be enriched
  with contextual knowledge and connected to additional learning resources. Our method
  begins by generating extended articles from video transcripts, leveraging LLMs to
  include historical insights, cultural examples, and illustrative anecdotes. A recommendation
  system employing semantic similarity ranking identifies related courses, followed
  by an LLM-based refinement process to enhance relevance. The final articles are
  tailored to seamlessly integrate these recommendations, ensuring they remain cohesive
  and informative. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our model produces high-quality
  content and accurate course suggestions, assessed through metrics such as Hit Rate,
  semantic similarity, and coherence. Our experimental analysis highlight the nuanced
  differences between the generated and existing materials, underscoring the modelâ€™s
  capacity to offer more engaging and accessible learning experiences. This study
  showcases how LLMs can bridge the gap between core content and supplementary learning,
  providing students with additional recommended resources while also assisting teachers
  in designing educational materials.
