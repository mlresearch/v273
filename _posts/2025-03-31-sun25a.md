title: 'MultiTutor: Collaborative LLM Agents for Multimodal Student Support'
abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized education,
  introducing AI tools that enhance teaching and learning. Once purely natural language
  processors, LLMs have evolved into autonomous agents capable of complex tasks, from
  software development to high-level trading decisions. However, most educational
  applications only focus on classroom simulations or single-agent automation, leaving
  the potential of multi-agent systems for personalized support underexplored. To
  address this, we propose MultiTutor, a multi-agent tutoring framework tailored to
  individual student needs. MultiTutor uses internet searches and code generation
  to produce multimodal outputs like images and animations while expert agents synthesize
  information to deliver explanatory text, create visualizations, suggest resources,
  design practice problems, and develop interactive simulations. By identifying knowledge
  gaps and scaffolding learning, MultiTutor offers a transformative, accessible approach
  to education. Evaluation against baseline models across metrics like cognitive complexity,
  readability, depth, and diversity shows MultiTutor consistently outperforms in quality
  and relevance. Case studies further highlight its potential as an innovative solution
  for automated tutoring and student support.
